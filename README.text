# Tweedcleaner

## Synopsis 

This is a very simple little app designed for the sole purpose of
cleaning up RSS feeds so that twitterfeed will accept them. A friend
of mine was setting up a Twitter feed of statewide news media, and a
half-dozen of them published their items without guid or pubDate
fields. Twitterfeed, being a more discerning site, doesn't accept
them. Tweedcleaner grabs any kind of feed, adds those fields and spits
the feed out as an RSS 2.0 file.
